## Overview
For this Skills-Based Assessment, you will demonstrate your ability to create a well-structured, responsive, and accessible web page using the HTML and CSS techniques you have learned. You will be assessed on your use of semantic HTML, CSS layout techniques (including Flexbox and Grid), and the implementation of accessibility features.

## Reflection Questions
1. What accessibility challenges did you face, and how did you address them?

*The most potent accessibility challenge was finding colors that were legible and looked good. I looked up accessible web fonts and used those for my design; with more time, I might consider doing some more work on the typography to make things look even better. Improvements could also be made to the responsive navbar (e.g., an `aria-hidden` attribute that's dynamically set and removed to assist screen readers), but I ran out of time to research and implement that piece.*

2. How did you ensure that your design was responsive and accessible to all users?

*I used responsive flexbox and grid design patterns. I sized all the text and spacing with "em" units. I set a breakpoint for mobile users. I used semantic HTML and ARIA labels and roles where it made sense to.*

3. What tools or resources did you find most helpful during this project?

*I used the Lighthouse Tool in Chrome to review the site's accessibility. I used [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) and [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) for reference. Icons and images came from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) and [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/). [ColorHexa](https://www.colorhexa.com/) was a valuable reference for color values.*
